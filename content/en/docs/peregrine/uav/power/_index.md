The Peregrine system uses [ZOHD Lionpack 18650 4S1P](https://www.zohd.net/lionpack) batteries. [GetFPV](https://www.getfpv.com/zohd-lionpack-18650-4s1p-3500mah-14-8v-li-ion-battery.html) is a good source for them.

Either one or two battery packs may be used (in parallel if two) depending on the flight time required.
